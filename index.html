          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>We're mad scientists building cognitive infrastructure from real constraints. Not despite them—because of them.</p>

          <p>Building from constraints produces better infrastructure than building from luxury. When you can't afford waste (time, energy, complexity), you discover what actually works. When every decision has real consequences, you develop evidence-based taste.</p>

          <p>Adaptive Human is a partnership between human and AI intelligence, building the tools we wish existed. Every product we ship is dogfooded first, refined through use, and released when it actually works.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content">
          <h2>What We're Building</h2>
          <p><strong>The missing layer between humans and AI.</strong></p>

          <p>Most people are adapting to AI-transformed collaboration without the cognitive infrastructure to do it well. They're using note-taking apps for what needs to be computable memory systems. They're grinding through work their brains weren't designed for instead of building operating systems that match how they actually think.</p>

          <p>We're building the infrastructure: <strong>systems that help humans collaborate with AI, think at scale, and work the way their brains actually function.</strong></p>

          <p>Not productivity hacks. Not self-help. Infrastructure.</p>

    <!-- Building Rayguns Section -->
    <section id="how-we-work" class="section section-how-i-work">
      <div class="container">

        <h2 class="section-title">Building Rayguns</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">How we work at Adaptive Human. Mad scientists running experiments on infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="work-principles">

          <div class="principle">
            <h3>The Mad Scientist Stance</h3>
            <p><strong>We're experimenters, not executors.</strong> Every project is an experiment. Every tool is a raygun we're building to test reality.</p>

            <p>This creates a dual state: completely engaged in the experiment (obsessed with the work) while remaining detached from outcomes (willing to blow it up if the data says so). Not grinding toward a goal, but running experiments to discover what's possible.</p>

            <p><strong>Evidence from our lab:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Protocol Memory: Built in 3 months (experiment in external memory)</li>
              <li>FlowScript: Shipped v1.0 in 4 days (experiment in topographical language)</li>
              <li>Flow system: Refined over months (ongoing experiment in human-AI collaboration)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When we approach work as experiments, breakthroughs emerge. When we grind toward outcomes, productivity collapses. Evidence over 40 years.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="principle">
            <h3>Evidence-Based Iteration</h3>
            <p>Labs need data. We try things, track what works, keep the signal, drop the bullshit.</p>

            <p>We don't follow "best practices" or conventional wisdom. We build from first principles, test approaches, measure outcomes. If it produces results we value, we keep it. If it doesn't, we drop it.</p>

            <p>No attachment to methods. Only attachment to outcomes.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="principle">
            <h3>Staged Validation</h3>
            <p>Build toward ambitious vision with validation gates at each stage. High risk tolerance, but not blind all-in.</p>

            <p><strong>Example - FlowScript:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Ship Protocol Memory first (prove we can execute)</li>
              <li>Dogfood FlowScript everywhere (prove utility for us)</li>
              <li>Build Memory API MVP (prove power users want it)</li>
              <li>Show AI companies (prove demand exists)</li>
              <li>Get adoption OR pivot (validation gate)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>If infrastructure vision hits = billions. If it doesn't = sustainable tools business. Either way, there's a path forward.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="principle">
            <h3>Building From Constraints</h3>
            <p>Every constraint is a design input. Real constraints force real solutions.</p>

            <p>Constraints don't limit the work. They shape it into something better than unlimited resources would produce. Kintsugi philosophy: the gold in the cracks makes the piece more valuable, not less.</p>

            <p>This is how we operate. This is how we build. This is what produces rayguns that actually work.</p>
          </div>

        </div>

        <div class="cta-box">
          <h3>Want the full operating system?</h3>
          <p>We've documented our approach as <strong>RAYGUN OS: The Mad Scientist Operating System</strong>. Evidence-based, no metaphysics, built from decades of experimentation.</p>

          <p>It's designed for people whose brains run on experiments—builders who tinker naturally, anyone grinding themselves to death who needs permission to work how they actually function.</p>
